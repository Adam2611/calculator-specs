## Update Calculator keyboard for greater consistency and extensibility

### Problem Statement
The Calculator keyboard requires some changes to meet the demands of upcoming features, including graphing mode and always-on-top mode. Furthermore, the current standard keyboard could be better at accommodating scaled screen sizes, which improves overall accessibility of the app. There are a number of other problems this spec seeks to address, including reducing confusion over the up arrow used as the shift key and reducing the number of keyboard layout states.

### Evidence or User Insights
The current keyboard is not scalable to support new minimum size requirements for CompactOverlay mode, nor is it extensible to support additional functionality in graphing calculator.

### Proposal
Update they keyboard app-wide for increased consistency and greater extensibility to prepare for upcoming feature improvements.

### Goals and Non-Goals
**Goals**
* No functionality takebacks in existing calculator modes
* Opportunistically add missing functionality across modes
* Increase clarity around shifted operations

**Non-Goals**
* Changes to display option buttons are out of scope (e.g., BYTE/WORD mode in programmer calculator), unless the button is better suited to be included in the keyboard

### Feature Requirements
<!-- Specific feature requirements or user scenarios. These typically starts with statements like “User can” or “API supports”. Leave details for next section. -->

### Feature Details and High-Fidelity Concept
<!-- Show a detailed look at the experience. Make sure you cover all possible flows. Include any alternative designs that were considered. Call out if strings being used are proposed or final. Don’t forget about edge and error cases. Keep in mind compliance and other quality considerations. This should take the form of polished design comps and/or screenshots combined with textual descriptions. -->

### Appendix
<!-- Phases: For larger projects, it may be useful to break the plan into phases (e.g., crawl, walk, run). If applicable, detail that plan here. -->
